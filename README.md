This repo represents my plodding, meticulous notetaking from [FastAIâ€™s
Practical Deep Learning Part II](https://course.fast.ai). Hence, SlowAI
ðŸ˜´

These notebook contains copied code from the [course
repository](https://github.com/fastai/course22p2/tree/master) and,
therefore, no part of this work should be considered original. **Most of
it is rewritten to reflect my code aesthetics and to clarify
mathematical points, which is the reason I am sharing it.** However, all
credit goes to Jeremy Howard except where noted otherwise.
